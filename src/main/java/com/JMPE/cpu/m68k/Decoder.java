/**
 * Decodes a single M68000 instruction from its raw bit encoding into a
 * structured {@link DecodedInstruction}.
 *
 * <h2>Responsibility boundary</h2>
 * The Decoder is responsible for exactly one thing: transforming a 16-bit opword
 * (plus any required extension words) into a fully typed description of an
 * instruction. It never reads or writes registers, flags, or data memory. Its
 * only permitted I/O is reading extension words from the Bus — words that are
 * architecturally part of the instruction encoding itself, not data operands.
 *
 * <h2>Why the opword is passed in rather than fetched here</h2>
 * The CPU's fetch/decode boundary is semantically real. On the physical 68000,
 * the first word of every instruction has already been consumed from the bus by
 * the time decode logic runs (the chip has a prefetch queue). Mirroring that
 * boundary in software means:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Tests can call {@code decode(opword, null, 0)} for any instruction that
 *       has no extension words, with no Bus dependency at all.</li>
 *   <li>The Disassembler can reuse this class without triggering real memory I/O,
 *       because the opword is just an integer it already holds.</li>
 *   <li>{@code M68kCpu.step()} visibly shows the fetch step before calling
 *       decode, making the code self-documenting.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Why the Bus IS passed for extension words</h2>
 * Extension words (immediates, displacements, full EA extensions) are part of the
 * instruction stream — not data accesses. The 68000 programmer's model defines
 * them as being consumed at decode time, advancing PC as they go. The Decoder
 * must read them to produce a complete description, and it is correct to do so
 * via the Bus. The alternative — pre-fetching all possible extension words in the
 * CPU before decode — is impossible because the number of extension words is not
 * known until the opword is partially decoded.
 *
 * <h2>Statelessness</h2>
 * The Decoder holds no mutable state. Every decode call is a pure function of its
 * arguments. This makes it safe to share across threads, trivial to test in
 * isolation, and free of ordering bugs.
 *
 * <h2>Intended call site in M68kCpu.step()</h2>
 * <pre>
 *   int opword = bus.readWord(registers.pc);
 *   DecodedInstruction decoded = decoder.decode(opword, bus, registers.pc + 2);
 *   registers.pc = decoded.nextPc();   // decoder consumed all extension words
 *   Op handler = dispatchTable.lookup(decoded.opcode());
 *   handler.execute(cpu, decoded);
 * </pre>

     * Decodes a MOVE or MOVEA instruction for any of the three MOVE lines.
     *
     * <h3>Opword layout</h3>
     * <pre>
     *   15:14  line high bits (00 for all three MOVE lines)
     *   13:12  size:  01=BYTE (line 1), 10=LONG (line 2), 11=WORD (line 3)
     *   11:9   destination register
     *    8:6   destination EA mode
     *    5:3   source EA mode
     *    2:0   source EA register
     * </pre>
     *
     * <h3>The reversed destination field</h3>
     * Every other instruction encodes a source EA as mode={bits 5:3},
     * reg={bits 2:0}. MOVE is the only instruction where the destination EA
     * uses the <em>upper</em> part of the opword, with the fields swapped:
     * mode is in bits 8:6 and register is in bits 11:9. This is unique to
     * MOVE in the entire 68k ISA and exists because MOVE is also the only
     * instruction that encodes two general EAs in a single opword. Motorola
     * needed somewhere to put the second EA and the upper bits were available.
     *
     * <p>The generic {@link #decodeEa} method cannot be used for the destination
     * without explicit field extraction, because it always reads mode from
     * bits 5:3 and reg from bits 2:0. Two dedicated local variables
     * ({@code dstMode}, {@code dstReg}) extract the destination fields before
     * calling {@code decodeEa}.
     *
     * <h3>Extension word order</h3>
     * When both source and destination require extension words (e.g.,
     * {@code MOVE.L (xxx).L, (xxx).L}), the source extension words come
     * <em>first</em> in the instruction stream, followed by the destination
     * extension words. This matches the left-to-right reading order of the
     * assembly syntax. The cursor is advanced through source first, then
     * destination — the order of the two {@code decodeEa} calls is therefore
     * not arbitrary and must not be swapped.
     *
     * <h3>MOVE vs MOVEA</h3>
     * When the destination mode field is {@code 001} (address register direct),
     * the instruction is MOVEA, not MOVE. They differ in two behaviour-critical
     * ways that the executor must handle:
     * <ol>
     *   <li>MOVEA <em>never</em> affects the condition codes. MOVE always does.</li>
     *   <li>MOVEA with WORD size sign-extends the 16-bit source value to 32 bits
     *       before writing the full address register. MOVE.W to a data register
     *       writes only the low 16 bits.</li>
     * </ol>
     * Emitting {@code Opcode.MOVEA} for this case lets the executor implement
     * these differences with a single opcode check rather than inspecting the
     * destination EA type at runtime.
     *
     * <p>MOVEA.B does not exist on the 68000. If destination mode is {@code 001}
     * and the size is BYTE, the opword is illegal and we throw accordingly.
     *
     * <h3>MOVE.B with An as source</h3>
     * For MOVE.B (line 1 only), address register direct ({@code mode=001}) is
     * not a valid <em>source</em> EA. The spec explicitly states: "For byte size
     * operation, address register direct is not allowed." We detect this here
     * and throw {@link IllegalInstructionException}, which the CPU routes to
     * the illegal instruction exception vector — exactly what real hardware does.
     *
     * @param size   the operand size, determined by which line (1/2/3) we are in
     * @param op     the raw 16-bit opword
     * @param bus    the system bus, for reading extension words
     * @param cursor the instruction-stream read cursor; updated in place
