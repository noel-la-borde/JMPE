/**
 * A contiguous, mappable region of the Mac Plus address space.
 *
 * <p>Instances are registered with {@link AddressSpace}, which dispatches
 * every bus read and write to whichever region owns the target address.
 * Typical implementations include {@link Ram}, {@link Rom}, and
 * device-backed MMIO regions.
 *
 * <h2>Address contract</h2>
 * Every address passed to {@code read*} / {@code write*} is a <em>local</em>
 * offset from {@link #base()} — i.e. already subtracted by the caller
 * ({@link AddressSpace}).  Implementations must not subtract the base again.
 *
 * <h2>Size and alignment</h2>
 * {@link #size()} must be a power of two and must be ≥ 2.
 * The 68000 requires word and long accesses to be word-aligned; the bus
 * enforces this before any region is called, so regions themselves need
 * not re-check alignment.
